# Taradvent

It is generally considered a very wholesome idea to create a custom advent calendar for the people you love. I was researching for different kinds of advent calendars you can buy or DIY to put custom messages in it for my girlfriend Tara. Then, I remembered: Wait, I'm actually an app developer. So on a cloudy Saturday afternoon, I was able to very quickly build this little app thanks to Flutter.
